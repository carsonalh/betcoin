You're at the bar with your mate. He swears that he 42 pretzels in his mouth. Obviously, you call his bluff and bet him $10. This happens every week, but he always bails with the cash. How can you ensure he pays this time. With blockchain of course!

Betcoin is a blockchain-based betting application so that your sleezy friends will never cheat you. By placing smart contracts on etherium, Betcoin gets the world to watch and validate your drunken wagers. Each decentralised bet can then be adjudicated by who you select with the transactions through to your account. NFTs, big data, ML... how many more buzzwords do we need to sell you over?
